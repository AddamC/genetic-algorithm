# A Genetic Algorithm approach made in Processing.

This project simulates a set of "characters" traveling in a field amongst objects in which it might collide. Each one in it's own context.

The objetive of this project is to improve the routes the characters end up taking. 

## Learning Process
In order to stimulate the learning process of this project, we defined the following rules:
1. Hitting red squares is bad for the score in a cycle 
2. Hitting purple squares improves the score in a cycle
3. Generate different routes for the same character in the same defined world
5. In each cycle, a few of the best performing subjects will be choosen to be applied in the genetic algorithm
6. Start a new cycle considering new routes stimulating better results for each cycle

As time passes, better routes will be taken (avoiding red objects and going through purple ones more frequently).
